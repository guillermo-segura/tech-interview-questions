# Behavioural questions

Behavioural questions aim to assess how candidates behaved in past situations, as this can be indicative of future performance. These questions usually follow the STAR format

- **Situation:** Describe a challenging situation you faced in a previous job or project.

`In my previous role, we had a tight deadline for a project, and our team was struggling with communication breakdowns`

- Task: Explain the task or goal you were working towards in that situation.

`Our task was to deliver a comprehensive report to the client within a week, and it required collaboration among team members with different expertise`

- Action: Share your specific actions to address the situation and accomplish the task.

`I initiated daily stand-up meetings to enhance communication, clarified each team member's responsibilities, and established a shared online workspace for efficient document sharing`

- Result: Detail the outcome of your actions and what you learned from the experience.

`As a result, our team met the deadline, and the client praised our collaborative approach. I learned the importance of proactive communication and project organization`

When responding, focus on your specific actions, their impact, and the lessons learned from each experience. This approach will help showcase your skills and problem-solving abilities effectively.
