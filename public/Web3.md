## What can you tell me about Verifiable Credential Workflow?

There are four elements in this workflow:

1. **Issuer**: Creates the credential and issues it to the holder.

2. **Holder**: Owns the credential and controls whom they share these credentials with.

3. **Verifier**: Receives the credential information and confirms the information stored is true without the intervention of the issuer.

4. **Verifiable Data Registry**: Stores identifiers and schemas.

## What do you know of decentralized identity?

Decentralized Identity is a digital identity management system where individuals have complete control over their personal information. It uses cryptography to allow individuals to create and control their unique identifiers (DIDs). They can use these identifiers to obtain Verifiable Credentials from trusted organizations and present parts of these credentials as proof of claims about themselves. Individuals can take ownership of their identity, rendering a centralized service provider unnecessary.

**Benefits:**

- Empowers individuals with control over their data.

- Simplifies processes for organizations.

- Saves administrative time and costs.

- Improves audit trails.

## Identification VS Authentication

- **Identification**: The things used to prove an identity.

- **Authentication**: The validation process used to identify yourself to other entities.

## What is a Trust Framework?

A Trust Framework is a group of practices and principles set for the diverse stakeholders that make up a network or ecosystem. It includes the rules of the road: policies, criteria for interoperability, and technical specifications.

## What do you know about Web3?

Web3 is the third version of the World Wide Web, which involves giving users control of their data and the use of blockchain technologies. Overall, it is a vision of a decentralized web.

## What are digital twins?

Digital twins are digital representations of physical entities or processes.

## What is eKYC?

eKYC stands for electronic Know Your Customer. It is a process where authorized organizations and agents verify a customer's identity and address digitally.

## What is a white-label product?

A white-label product is a brandless product that will be sold to a company, which will then brand and sell the product as its own.

## What is digital identity?

Digital identity is a 1-1 relationship between an entity, usually a human, and its digital presence. In the context of Web3, it would be a Decentralized Identifier (DID).
