# General Questions

## Differences between framework VS library

Libraries are called by the code but frameworks call our code. This is an Inversion of Control (IoC) as the framework maintains control of the application.

## What's the purpose of a load balancer

Invisible facilitator between the user and a group of servers, ensuring the server resources are distributed equally across the requests. Related to horizontal scalability.

## What is a Promise (JS) ⭐

Object that will produce a single value sometime in the future. If the promise is successful, it will produce a resolved value, but if something goes wrong then it will produce a reason why the promise failed.

- Pending: This is the default state of a defined promise
- Fulfilled: This is the state of a successful promise
- Rejected: This is the state of a failed promise

## Elasticsearch

Search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. Elasticsearch is developed in Java and its official clients are available in Java, .NET (C#), PHP, Python, Ruby and many other languages. According to the DB-Engines ranking, Elasticsearch is the most popular enterprise search engine. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch).

## What is security in the context of SE

Security refers to the practice of protecting software systems and data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It involves implementing various measures such as authentication, authorization, encryption, and secure coding practices to mitigate potential security threats and vulnerabilities.

## What is reliability in the context of SE

It refers to the ability of a software system to perform consistently and in a predictable manner even in the presence of failures or unexpected events. It encompasses aspects such as fault tolerance, error handling, and infrastructure robustness and is achieved through thorough testing, monitoring, and implementation of redundancy or failover mechanisms to minimize downtime and ensure continuous operation.

## What is scalability

The capability of a software system to handle increasing workload or user demand by efficiently expanding its resources or infrastructure without compromising performance or responsiveness. It is essential for accommodating growing user bases, increasing data volumes, or handling spikes in traffic without experiencing degradation in system performance.

## What is platform management

Platform management involves overseeing the infrastructure, environment, and tools used to support software development, deployment, and operation. This includes managing hardware resources, operating systems, middleware, development frameworks, and other software components required to host and run applications effectively. Platform management also encompasses tasks such as provisioning, configuration, monitoring, and optimization of the development and production environments to ensure their reliability, security, and performance.

## Development Evangelism

Development evangelism is the practice of promoting and advocating for software development platforms, technologies, frameworks, or best practices within the developer community. It involves engaging with developers through various channels such as conferences, workshops, forums, social media, and developer communities to educate, inspire, and encourage the adoption of specific technologies or methodologies. Development evangelists often collaborate with product teams, contribute to documentation and tutorials, and provide support and guidance to developers to help them succeed with the adopted technologies.

## Developer Advocate Experience

Developer advocate experience focuses on enhancing the experience and satisfaction of developers who use a particular platform, tool, or technology. It involves understanding the needs, challenges, and preferences of developers and advocating for improvements, enhancements, or features that can enhance their productivity, usability, and overall satisfaction. Developer advocate experience encompasses aspects such as documentation quality, API design, developer tooling, community support, and responsiveness to feedback, aiming to create a positive and empowering experience for developers using the platform.

## CDN

A Content Delivery Network is a geographically distributed group of servers that caches content close to end users. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos. The popularity of CDN services continues to grow, and today the majority of web traffic is served through CDNs, including traffic from major sites like Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon. A properly configured CDN may also help protect websites against some common malicious attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks. While a CDN does not host content and can’t replace the need for proper web hosting, it does help cache content at the network edge, which improves website performance. Many websites struggle to have their performance needs met by traditional hosting services, which is why they opt for CDNs.
