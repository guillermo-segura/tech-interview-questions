# Express.js

## What is Express.js and why is it popular?

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs. It is popular because it provides a minimalist and flexible approach to web development, allowing developers to create scalable and maintainable applications with ease.

## How does Express.js handle routing?

Express.js provides a routing mechanism to define routes for handling incoming HTTP requests. Routes are defined using methods like `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `app.put()`, and `app.delete()`, specifying the HTTP method and the route path. Each route can have one or more middleware functions that are executed when the route is matched.

## What are middleware functions in Express.js and how are they used?

Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that have access to the request, response, and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. They can modify the request and response objects, terminate the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function using the `next()` function.

## Explain the concept of request and response objects in Express.js.

- The request object (`req`) represents the HTTP request sent by the client to the server, containing information about the request such as URL, HTTP headers, query parameters, and body data.

- The response object (`res`) represents the HTTP response that the server sends back to the client, containing methods to set HTTP headers, status code, and send data back to the client.

## What is a templating engine and which templating engines are commonly used with Express.js?

A templating engine is a tool that allows you to generate dynamic HTML content by mixing static HTML markup with dynamic data. Commonly used templating engines with Express.js include Pug (formerly Jade), EJS (Embedded JavaScript), Handlebars, and Mustache.

## What are route parameters in Express.js and how are they used?

Route parameters in Express.js are placeholders in route paths that capture values from incoming URL segments. They are specified in route paths using colon syntax (e.g., `:id`). Route parameters are accessible in route handlers via the `req.params` object.

## Describe the difference between app.get() and app.use() in Express.js.

- `app.get()` is used to define a route handler for HTTP GET requests with a specific route path.

- `app.use()` is used to register middleware functions that are executed for all HTTP requests, regardless of the HTTP method and route path.

## What is the purpose of app.listen() in Express.js?

`app.listen()` is used to start a web server and listen for incoming connections on a specified port. It binds the Express application to a network address and port number, allowing it to handle incoming HTTP requests.

## How do you serve static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) in Express.js?

Express.js provides the `express.static()` middleware to serve static files such as CSS, JavaScript, images, and other resources. It is typically used to specify a directory from which to serve static files.

## What is the purpose of next() in Express.js middleware?

`next()` is a function provided by Express.js to pass control to the next middleware function in the request-response cycle. It is typically called within middleware functions to delegate control to subsequent middleware functions.

## How can you handle form data in Express.js?

Form data can be handled in Express.js using middleware such as `body-parser` or `multer`. `body-parser` is used to parse incoming request bodies in URL-encoded or JSON format.

## Explain the difference between req.query and req.params in Express.js.

- `req.query` contains the query parameters parsed from the URL's query string.

- `req.params` contains route parameters captured from the URL's route path.

## What is middleware stacking in Express.js and how is it useful?

Middleware stacking refers to the practice of stacking multiple middleware functions together using `app.use()` or `router.use()`. This allows you to apply middleware functions to multiple routes or to create reusable sets of middleware for specific purposes.

## Can you implement authentication using middleware in Express.js?

Yes, authentication can be implemented using middleware in Express.js. Middleware functions can be used to verify user credentials, check session data, and enforce authentication requirements for protected routes.

## How can you handle file uploads in Express.js?

File uploads can be handled in Express.js using middleware such as `multer`. `multer` is used to parse `multipart/form-data` and handle file uploads, providing options for specifying file upload limits, file storage destinations, and more.

## Describe the role of the express.Router() middleware in Express.js routing.

`express.Router()` is used to create modular, mountable route handlers in Express.js. It allows you to define groups of routes and middleware in separate files or modules, improving code organization and maintainability.

## How do you handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in Express.js applications?

CORS in Express.js can be handled using the `cors` middleware or by implementing custom middleware to set the necessary CORS headers (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`) in the response to allow cross-origin requests from specific origins or methods.
